# Customer Personality Analysis

This notebook covers all steps of the data analysis process, excluding the data collection. It includes data cleaning, data processing and an extensive exploratory data analysis.
Lastly, I prepared, cleaned, decoded and scaled the data before reducing dimensionality and training a k-means model. Further analysis on the model in the future.

The data for the project came from Kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/imakash3011/customer-personality-analysis)
